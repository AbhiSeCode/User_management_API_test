# User Management API

This is a backend developer test project.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the required dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root directory to configure environment-specific settings. You can define environment variables in this file according to your needs. For your reference I have added `.env.dev` with variables names and dummy values

## Usage

To start the server, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

For development purposes, you can use the following command to start the server which automatically restarts the server when changes are made:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

The server will start running on the specified port.

## Testing

You can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

To run the tests in watch mode, allowing them to automatically re-run on file changes, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## API Documentation

The Swagger documentation for the API can be accessed at the following URL:

```
/api/docs
```

This will open the Swagger UI, where you can view and interact with the available API endpoints.
